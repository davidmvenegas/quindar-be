# Satellite Service Optimization

## Overview

This Python script optimizes satellite servicing opportunities to maximize revenue within fuel constraints. It utilizes two algorithms:

- **Greedy**: Quick selection based on the best revenue-to-fuel ratio.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Computes the optimal solution considering all combinations.

## Files

- `solution.py`: Contains the algorithms.
- `servicing_options.csv`: Test data.

## Requirements

Python and Pandas library (`pip install pandas`).

## Output

Displays the total revenue and number of opportunities selected.
